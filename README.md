Run any command you like in a deterministic [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/) shell on Linux and macOS.

## Usage

Create `shell.nix` in your repo, for example

```nix
{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:
  pkgs.mkShell {
    # nativeBuildInputs is usually what you want -- tools you need to run
    nativeBuildInputs = with pkgs; [ which nodejs python39 perl ];
}
```

Create `.github/workflows/test.yml` in your repo with the following contents:

```yaml
name: 'Test'
on:
  pull_request:
  push:
jobs:
  tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: cachix/install-nix-action@v14.1
        with:
          nix_path: nixpkgs=channel:nixos-unstable
      - uses: dx-oss/nix-shell-action@v11
        with:
          script: |
            which node
      - uses: dx-oss/nix-shell-action@v11
        with:
          interpreter: python3
          options: --attr x
          script: |
            print("hello world from python")
      - uses: dx-oss/nix-shell-action@v11
        with:
          interpreter: perl
          file: shell.nix
          script: |
            use warnings;
            print("Hello, World! from perl\n");
```

For now, this action implicitly depends on having [Nix] installed and set up correctly, such as through the [install-nix-action] demonstrated in the examples above.

See also [cachix-action](https://github.com/cachix/cachix-action) for a simple binary cache setup to speed up your builds and share binaries with developers.

## Options `with: ...`

- `interpreter`: Interpreter to use in the script, defaults to `bash`.

- `file`: nix-shell file, Defaults to `shell.nix`.

- `script`: The actual script to execute in your shell. Will be passed to the `interpreter`.

- `options`: Other options to pass along to the `nix-shell` command, like `--pure` or `--packages hello` or multiple options combined.
